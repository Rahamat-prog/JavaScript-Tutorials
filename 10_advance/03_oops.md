# JavaScript is a prototype-based language. 
# In summary, JavaScript isn’t a class-based OOP language, but it provides ways to implement OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism

4 pillars
Abstraction Encapsulation Inheritance Polymorphism


# Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In JavaScript, abstraction can be achieved through:\
# Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the bundling of data (properties) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class), and restricting access to some of the object's components.
# Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass), promoting code reuse and establishing an "is-a" relationship between classes
# Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It allows methods to be implemented in different ways in different classes, providing flexibility and extensibility.

 ** These four pillars—Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism—are foundational concepts of object-oriented programming that are applicable and implemented in JavaScript using its unique features and patterns.
