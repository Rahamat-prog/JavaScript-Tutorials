# Why Use Prototype Chain?
Now, let's relate this analogy to the question of why we use the prototype chain in JavaScript:

# Code Reusability:
Just like departments in an organization share common practices and resources, prototype objects in JavaScript facilitate code reusability.
Objects can inherit methods from their prototype, reducing redundancy and promoting modular programming.

# Dynamic Behavior:
The prototype chain allows for dynamic behavior modification. Changing the prototype affects all objects inheriting from it.
This flexibility enables runtime modifications and adaptations in JavaScript applications.

# Efficiency and Memory Management:
Using prototype chain optimizes memory usage by avoiding duplication of methods across multiple objects.
Instead of defining methods on every instance, JavaScript leverages prototype inheritance for efficient memory management.

# Example: Prototype Chain in JavaScript

// Prototype object representing a generic employee
const Employee = {
    role: 'Employee',
    describe() {
        return `I am a ${this.role}`;
    }
};

// Create Manager object inheriting from Employee
const Manager = Object.create(Employee);
Manager.role = 'Manager';

// Create Engineer object inheriting from Employee
const Engineer = Object.create(Employee);
Engineer.role = 'Engineer';

// Usage example
console.log(Manager.describe()); // Output: I am a Manager
console.log(Engineer.describe()); // Output: I am an Engineer
