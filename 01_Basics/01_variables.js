// JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages â€” many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes and classes. It also supports functional programming.

// variables 
// A variable is a named reference to a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.

const accountID = 9847387
let accountEmail = "hitesh@google.com"
var accountPassword = "12345"
let accountCity = "Jaipur"
let accountState

console.table([accountID, accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity, accountState]);


// ** accountID  = 2  tthis is not allow cause accountID is const variable

// ** prefer to not use var because of issue in block scope and functional scope 

// now change the value of these variables 

accountEmail = "Rahamat@123"
accountPassword = 2
accountCity = "Delhi"

console.table([accountEmail, accountPassword, accountCity]);
